  <h2>Big Balls Are Fun For Pew Pew</h2>
  <P>
    Balls should print at the correct size on the corresponding size
    paper when the printer is set to the correct size of paper. When printing be sure
    to select the correct paper size and do not request that the print be scaled or
    <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/79S6bswOYLI">shrank</A>/expanded to fit the page. 
  <P>
    Balls will attempt to print up to the full paper size you request.
    Normally, printers can not print to the full paper size, which
    can result in your Balls being trimmed slightly on the shorter
    dimension if you try to fit the Biggest Balls you can in the
    space you have available.
    If this happens, and you don't like your Balls trimmed, you will need
    to select a larger size of paper.

    <em><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deeMCYsyV94">You should always check your Balls before shooting them.</A></em>
    <P>If your Balls are not the desired size, you should try:
      <ul>
	<li> Ensuring that when your computer/device sent this to your printer, it was selecting the paper size corresponding to what you selected here.
	<li> Check your printer's settings to ensure both the printer and the tray in the printer are set to the size of paper that you have selected here. <em>Note that printers are infernal devices, and merely putting the correct size paper in them may not, as you might expect, do this for you.</em>
	<li> Saving the generated target you get here to a file with the '.pdf' extension and then opening it on your computer to print it directly to your printer, instead of printing it from the web browser you are using right now.
      </ul>
    <HR>
    <P>
    <em>My Balls are too big for my printer! What do I do?</em>
    <P>If you don't wish to buy a printer that is large enough to accomodate your Balls, You may be able to take the PDF generated by this page to a print shop which can print on any of the above paper formats.
