  <h2>Train to shoot your Lee Enfield for King and Empire</h2>
  <em>To know what to do, read the musketry manual:</em>
  <UL>

  </UL>
  <HR>
    <UL>
      <li> The first class target at full size is 72 x 72 inches, with a bull ring of 40 inches, and a magpie ring of 56 inches. A <em>prone figure</em> is an aiming mark in the upper half of the bull, offset slightly to the right. This figure had a height of 18 inches and a width of 21 inches.
	
      <li> The second class target at full size is 48 x 48 inches with a bull ring of 24 inches, and a magpie ring of 36 inches. A <em>covered figure</em> is an aiming mark in the upper half of the bull, offset slightly to the right. This figure had a height of 12 inches and a width of 12 inches.
    </UL>
  <P>
    <UL>
    <LI>The Top half was supposed to be covered in gray or green paper
    <LI>The Bottom half was supposed to be covered in green or brown paper
    </UL>
    Presumably both being green at the same time wasn't normal, but who knows what could have happened when the Sergeant sent the detail with paper and paste to make targets.
 <P>    
    This target generator makes the correct scoring rings on the page with an approximation of the figures, scaled for what paper you choose.
  <P>
    Since many of the paper sizes here are not square, this generator will only print a square equivalent to the smaller paper dimension, leaving out the top and bottom of the page. These will print correctly when printed on a printer with the corresponding size paper, and the printer set to not attempt to scale or shrink / expand the page to fit. If you find a print shop with a 48 inch plotter, they will probably work at 48x48.
