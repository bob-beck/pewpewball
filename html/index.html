  <h2>Print Your Own Targets </h2>
  <P> I like to shoot at paper. Sometimes getting paper to shoot at is harder than it should be.
  <P> This is a collection of little projects that I have found useful after being <A HREF="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png">nerd sniped</A> by problems with printable targets. Too many did not meet my needs or work well for me. As <A HREF="quigley.jpg">I have past experiences with printers and an real dislike for them</A>, I was doomed to try to make something better.
  <P> All targets you make with this site are free for you to do whatever you like with. They are all the output of computer programs that are Open Source. The output of your use of the tools made available to you here, is yours.

    If you have difficulty getting targets you generate here to print nicely, remember to try:
      <ul>
	<li> Ensuring that when your computer/device sends a target to your printer, it selects the paper size corresponding to what you selected when generating the target..
	<li> Checking your printer's settings to ensure that both the printer and the tray in the printer are set to the size of paper that you selected when generating the target. <em>Note that printers are infernal devices, and merely putting the correct size paper in them may not, as you might expect, do this for you.</em>
	<li> Saving the generated target you generate here to a file with the '.pdf' extension and then opening it on your computer to print it directly to your printer, instead of printing it from the web browser you are using right now.
      </ul>
