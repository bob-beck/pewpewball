    The targetry specified in Stanhope Blunt's 1889 Manual for

    <UL>
      <LI> Target A was 48 x 72 inches, with an 8/10 inch elliptical bull,
	and 24/30 inch elliptical inner ring, and a 40/50 inch elliptical outer ring.
	This was shot at 100, 200, and 300 yards.
      <LI> Target B was 72 x 72 inches, with an 18/24 inch elliptical bull,
	and 36/48 inch elliptical inner ring, and a 52/72 inch elliptical outer ring.
	This was shot at 300, 400, and 500 yards.
      <LI> Target C was 144 x 72 inches, with an 32/45 inch elliptical
	bull, and 51/72 inch elliptical inner ring, The outer score is

    All targets were to be printed with black bull and lines on "very
