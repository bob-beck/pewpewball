  <title>Target Trim Area</title>

  <h2>Trim Area? Why? It's So Confusing? I hate Printers!</h2>
  <em>It's ok.. I hate them too.. </em>
  <P>
  <em>It is often confusing to know if you should use this</em>
  
  <P> I have included this because most printers can not print right
    to the edge of a sheet of paper. Typically they can not print within
    0.25 inches of the edge.
  <P> If you specify the trim area, the target generator will shrink
    the printed area by that much, and will also reduce the target
    scale by a corresponding amount.

    Examples:
    <UL>
      <li> If you print a target that is 8.5 x 8.5 inches in dimension
      on an 8.5 x 11 paper, specifying a 0.25 inch trim will scale the
      target down to an 8 x 8 inch dimension.
      <li> If you print a target that is 48 x 48 inches in dimension
      on a 48 x 48 paper, specifiying a 0.25 inch trim will scale the
      target down to 47.5 x 47.5 inch dimension.
    </UL>

    This has the effect of changing the size of everything (including
    the scoring rings) on your target and changes the distance you
    shoot it at to mimic the original.

  <P> For some targets, such as a british 1887 figure target, features
      of the target go right to the edge of it. On 8.5 x 11 inch
      paper, printed, the very points of the figures will not be
      printed by a printer that can not print to the edge of the
      paper. since a large portion of the "end" of the figure is cut
      off, the target "looks funny" and with trim, the target looks
      better, and you slightly change the distance you shoot at. For a
      small target that is reduced a lot from the original, this may
      be what you end up wanting. 
  <P>
    <EM> Most of the time you probably will <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> want
    to trim large sized targets. </EM>
  <P>
   Considering the same british 1887 figure target, if we were
   printing it full size (or close to it) we probably care much more
   about the inner scoring rings being the correct size, than if the
   outer edge has printing on it. If we are scoring a hit for outer
   anywhere on the paper, the *paper* is still the correct size for our
   scale, and corresponds to the printed target inner ring sizes <em>even if
   there is a small outer band the printer could not print</em>. The
   target will also not look as "funny" because in the example of the
   british 1887 figures, proportionally, taking 1/4 inch off the top
   of a 48 inch tall figure is much less noticable than taking 1/4
   inch off the top of an 8.5 inch figure.
  <P>
   Happy shooting!
