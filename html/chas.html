  <h2>Make a CHAS service Rifle Target</h2>
   Welcome to the target generator for CHAS Service rifle league.
  <P>
    These targets should print at the correct size on the corresponding size
    paper when the printer is set to the correct size of paper.<BR> <STRONG><EM>When printing be sure
    to select the correct paper size and do not request that the print be scaled or

    <UL>
      <LI> The standard centrefire match target is shot at 200 and 300M, and must be printed on 18x24 paper.
      <LI> The standard rimfire match uses two different targets:
	<UL>
	  <LI> When the centrefire match shoots at 200M, rimfire shoots a target at 50M scaled to match the size of the centrefire target at 200M. It must be printed on Letter paper.
	  <LI> When the centrefire match shoots at 300M, rimfire shoots a target at 100M scaled to match the size of the centrefire target at 300M. It must be printed on Letter paper.
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <P>
    We have one match of the year, the "Norway" match, where all target sizes are reduced by 2/3 (For both centrefire and rimfire). The centrefire target is printed on 11x17 paper, and the rimfire targets on Letter paper. 
  <P>
    We also have a special "303" match that shoots on <A HREF="1909.html">historical British 1909 Musketry targets.</A>

	If you have difficulty getting targets you generate here to print nicely, remember to try:
	<ul>
	  <li> Ensuring that when your computer/device sends a target to your printer, it does not select scaling or "fit to page" which will make the printer change the target size.
	  <li> Ensuring that when your computer/device sends a target to your printer, it selects the paper size corresponding to what you selected when generating the target..
	  <li> Checking your printer's settings to ensure that both the printer and the tray in the printer are set to the size of paper that you selected when generating the target. <em>Note that printers are infernal devices, and merely putting the correct size paper in them may not, as you might expect, do this for you.</em>
	  <li> Saving the generated target you generate here to a file with the '.pdf' extension and then opening it on your computer to print it directly to your printer, instead of printing it from the web browser you are using right now.
	</ul>
